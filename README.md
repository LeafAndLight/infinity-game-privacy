Developer / Organization: Leaf and Light Studios  
Contact: leafandlightstudio@gmail.com  

## 1. Introduction

Infinity Game is developed by Leaf and Light Studios.  
This Privacy Policy explains:

- what data the app collects or processes,  
- how that data is used, and  
- how users may request deletion of their data.

This policy applies only to Infinity Game on Meta Quest devices and does not cover Meta, your headset operating system, or any other apps.

---

## 2. Summary (Short Version)

Infinity Game processes only a small amount of data that is necessary to:

- verify your entitlement to the game and in-app purchases (IAP),  
- deliver purchased items, and  
- (if enabled) participate in online leaderboards.

We do **not** collect or request your real name, email address, physical address, precise location, or payment card details.

Infinity Game does **not** send data to servers owned by Leaf and Light Studios.  
All online communication is between your headset and Meta’s platform services (for example: IAP, entitlement checks, cloud saves, and leaderboards).

The game can be played offline, but the following features require an internet connection:

- In-App Purchases via the Meta Store  
- Online entitlement checks for ownership of the game and add-ons  
- (If enabled) Official Meta online leaderboard and cloud saves

## 3. Data We Collect and Process

### 3.1 Personal Data

Infinity Game does **not** directly collect personal contact information such as:

- your real name  
- email address  
- phone number  
- postal address  

We also do **not** intentionally collect:

- voice recordings from the headset microphone,  
- photos or videos created outside normal Quest system behavior,  
- biometric data beyond what Meta already processes for tracking, or  
- any user-generated content unrelated to game progress.

Any such data that Meta processes is governed by Meta’s own privacy policy.

### 3.2 Data from Meta Account (USER_ID)

When you use Infinity Game, Meta provides a **Meta User ID (USER_ID)** to the game through the Meta Platform SDK.  
This is a unique identifier linked to your Meta account.

We use this USER_ID to:

- verify that you are entitled to use Infinity Game on your device,  
- verify and associate in-app purchases (for example, “Golden Key” or other add-ons) with your account, and  
- (if leaderboards are enabled) associate your scores with your account or display name.

Infinity Game does not use USER_ID for advertising or tracking across other apps.

### 3.3 In-App Purchase (IAP) Data

Infinity Game supports optional in-app purchases (“complementos”) that are processed by Meta.

When you make or restore a purchase, we receive from Meta information such as:

- product identifier (for example: `gold_key`),  
- status of the purchase (completed, refunded, etc.),  
- that the purchase belongs to your Meta account (through USER_ID), and  
- timestamps or other metadata provided by Meta.

We use this IAP data only to:

- unlock and deliver the purchased content in the game,  
- restore purchases if you reinstall the game or change devices, and  
- prevent fraud (for example, preventing use of items that have been refunded).

Infinity Game does **not** receive or store:

- your full payment card number,  
- full billing address, or  
- complete purchase history for other apps.

All payment processing is handled by Meta.

### 3.4 Leaderboard Data (Online Rankings)

Infinity Game may use Meta’s official leaderboard service to record and display rankings.

If you participate in online leaderboards, we process:

- your scores and related game stats (for example: max height reached, time, or similar metrics), and  
- a pseudonymous identifier such as your Meta User ID or display name, so your score can appear on the leaderboard.

This leaderboard data is stored and managed primarily by Meta.  
Infinity Game only sends and reads leaderboard entries through Meta’s APIs and does not operate its own leaderboard servers.

### 3.5 Technical and Analytics Data

Infinity Game does **not** send separate analytics data (for example: IP address, country, FPS, detailed telemetry) to servers controlled by Leaf and Light Studios.

Any technical or analytics data collected by Meta related to your headset, device, or Meta account is handled under Meta’s own privacy policy and platform settings.

---

## 4. Save Data

Player progress is stored only:

- locally on your Meta Quest device, and  
- optionally, in Meta’s cloud-save system if that feature is enabled for your account.

Save data may include:

- your current position or height,  
- items owned (for example: Golden Key, coins, other in-game resources),  
- vending machine or chest states,  
- gameplay options and settings (audio, graphics, controls), and  
- cached information about which extras or add-ons you own (entitlements).

This save data is used only by Infinity Game to run the game and is not sent to any server owned by Leaf and Light Studios.

---

## 5. Online Connectivity and Leaderboards

The game can be played offline, but the following actions require an internet connection:

- verifying your entitlement to Infinity Game and add-ons,  
- processing and restoring in-app purchases, and  
- sending and receiving leaderboard data (if the leaderboard feature is enabled).

When using the official Meta leaderboard, the following applies:

- Only the score and minimal identifying data (USER_ID or display name) required by Meta’s API are transmitted.  
- All leaderboard data is stored and managed by Meta’s systems.  
- Infinity Game does not store copies of leaderboard data on Leaf and Light Studios servers.

To request removal of leaderboard data from within Infinity Game, you can:

- contact Meta’s official support, and/or  
- contact Leaf and Light Studios at leafandlightstudio@gmail.com.  
  Where possible, we will use Meta’s tools to remove or anonymize your leaderboard entries.

---

## 6. In-App Purchases

All in-app purchases in Infinity Game are processed by Meta.

Infinity Game:

- does not receive your payment card details,  
- does not receive full billing address, and  
- does not independently process your financial information.

We only receive confirmation from Meta that:

- a specific product or add-on has been purchased by your account, or  
- a previous purchase is still valid (entitlement check).

We use this information only to unlock and maintain access to the purchased content inside the game.

---

## 7. Data Sharing

Infinity Game does **not** sell or share your data with third-party advertisers, data brokers, or analytics companies.

Data is shared only with:

- **Meta** – through the Meta Platform SDK and Meta services (entitlements, IAP, cloud saves, leaderboards).  

Leaf and Light Studios does not operate independent online servers for Infinity Game.

If you contact us directly by email for support, any information you provide (such as your email address and description of the issue) will be used only to respond to your request and may be stored in our support inbox. You can ask us to delete these messages at any time.

## 8. Data Deletion Requests

### 8.1 Deleting Save Data Yourself

You can delete local save data at any time by:

1. Uninstalling Infinity Game from your Meta Quest device; and/or  
2. Clearing the app’s data in the device’s system settings.

If you use Meta’s cloud-save feature, you may also need to delete the cloud save from your Meta account settings.

### 8.2 Deletion Requests to Leaf and Light Studios

You may request deletion of data that Leaf and Light Studios controls about you (for example: support emails or manually managed leaderboard entries) by contacting:

- **Email:** leafandlightstudio@gmail.com  

Please include enough information to identify your account, such as:

- your Meta display name, and/or  
- your Meta User ID (if you know it), and  
- the name of the game: *Infinity Game*.

Once we verify your identity, we will:

- delete or anonymize the data we control that is linked to your Meta User ID, and  
- where possible, use Meta’s tools to remove or anonymize related data in leaderboards or other platform features used by Infinity Game.

### 8.3 Data Controlled by Meta

Some data is controlled directly by Meta, including:

- your Meta account information,  
- your platform-level purchase history, and  
- platform analytics and telemetry.

To delete this data, you must use the privacy tools in your Meta account or contact Meta Support.  
If you are unsure which data we can delete and which data Meta controls, you can email us and we will explain your options.

## 9. Children’s Privacy

Infinity Game is not directed at children under the age of 13.  
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

If you believe that a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us at leafandlightstudio@gmail.com. We will delete the data that we control and, where appropriate, work with Meta to address the issue.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, for example if we add new online features such as additional leaderboards or services.

When we make changes, we will:

- update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this page, and  
- publish the updated version at the same URL where this policy is hosted.

We recommend that you review this Privacy Policy periodically so you are informed about how Infinity Game uses and protects your data.
